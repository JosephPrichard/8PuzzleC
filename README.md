# 8PuzzleC
AI written in C to solve the [sliding puzzle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) using the AStar algorithm. This AI is guaranteed to find the shortest number of steps to solve any solvable 8Puzzle. 

I'm working on a variety of optimizations including better heuristics, 3-heap, and robinhood hash tables.
